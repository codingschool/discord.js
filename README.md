# The Basics

> A decent knowledge about Javascript is necessary because not every part of the code will be that much detailed also you should have created a Bot in the Discord [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
</br></br>
# Creating the Project
> We'll need to create or node.js project and install all necessary Packages. To make it easy for you, you can use the ```package.json``` in this repo. After you downloaded the file open Visual Studio Code and Open a Terminal

> Opening a Terminal:

> After you have done that you only need to type in ```npm i``` and it will Install all packages that you need right now, If we start using new Packages you'll need to type the command again
</br></br>

# index.js

> The index file is the most important file in our code it will start the Bot and pass the client to other files such as the handlers etc.
> You can Start by opening the index.js in this Repo most of the things should be explained (make sure not to overlook the comments like this //comment) but before you do that look at the config file setion under this

# Config File
> We use the Config file to prevent others to se our Token , the Token is very important and should net be able to see for Others (that could end bad ) 
> For now you only need the paste your token in the config file. The mongo_url is not needed now.

> Your Config should look like this

# Start the Bot
> The start the bot you simply need to type in ```node .``` in your Terminal if Ecverthing works the Console log in the Ready event will appear in your terminal and thats it. In the next branch we are gonna start The Handler wich will be the biggest part of this Tutorial so make sure you read everthing :)
